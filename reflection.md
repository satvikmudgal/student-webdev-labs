### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

1. I was able to complete all HTML exercises on time without the help of videos since most of the lab exercises were discussed in class.
2. I found the form radio button formatting a little difficult to pass accessibility checks but it was easy enough once I figured out the nesting and the labelling with id.

### Accessibility

1. The CSS sections of the webpages were more challening to pass the accessibility audit. However, WAVE's UI is very useful.
2. Some errors such as Page has no region or no ARIA landmarks was confusing, then I understood how every webpage needs a main or a body to encompass the entire page. That alert took a long time to figure out.

### CSS

1. This was the most tedious part of the lab section since there were many elements that were to be individually styled and included as part of the grids.
2. There are still some grids in bootstrap that I did not complete as I could not figure out the columns and the class styles that I was expected to use.
3. The webpages where every element from a list in selectors was to be chosen to individually colored was also very tedious, however, none of it was challenging to understand or to grasp. I knew what I was doing, but doing it took a lot of time.
